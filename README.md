# Unknown-Input-Observer-Review-and-Examples
The UIO is reviewed in a PDF file and Simulink examples from control theory are given.
This submission reviews UIO theory (see pdf file) and provides three common examples from control theory: the coupled mass spring system, the quarter car suspension system model and an example found in the literature. Each example demonstrates how the UIO observer decouples the state estimation from the disturbance inputs imparted on the dynamic system. MATLAB and Simulink files are provided along with a PDF file to guide the student through the examples.
